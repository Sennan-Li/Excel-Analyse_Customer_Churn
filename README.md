#### **Key Churn Drivers:**
1.  🆚 **Competitive Offers:** Customers are leaving primarily due to better offers (price, data, speed, devices) from competitors.
2.  🤝 **Support Interactions:** Negative experiences with support (attitude) are also a major reason for leaving.
3.  🔧  **Product Issues:** Reliability and product dissatisfaction also contribute to churn.

#### **Demographic & Usage Insights:**

- 📶 **Data Consumption:** Churn is highest among users consuming 5-10GB. Lack of an unlimited plan appears correlated with higher churn across usage tiers.

#### **Summary:**
High churn is driven mainly by competitive pressures and poor support experiences. Targeted strategies, improving customer support, and investigating regional issues (especially in high-churn states) are recommended. Additionally, the older demographic requires tailored interventions to address their unique needs and preferences.
