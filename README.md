**Overall:**
* **Total Customers:** 6,687
* **Churned:** 1,796
* **Churn Rate:** 26.86% (Significant)

**Key Churn Drivers:**
1.  **Competitive Offers:** Customers are leaving primarily due to better offers (price, data, speed, devices) from competitors.
2.  **Support Interactions:** Negative experiences with support (attitude) are also a major reason for leaving.
3.  **Product Issues:** Reliability and product dissatisfaction also contribute to churn.

**Demographic & Usage Insights:**
* **Age:** While the largest customer age group is '30-65' (44%), churn rate noticeably increases for older age groups (especially 79-88).
* **Data Consumption:** Churn is highest among users consuming 5-10GB. Lack of an unlimited plan appears correlated with higher churn across usage tiers.
* **Geography:** Churn is exceptionally high in specific states, notably CA (75%), IN (67%), and NH (63%).

**Summary:**
High churn is driven mainly by competitive pressures and poor support experiences. Targeted strategies, improving customer support, and investigating regional issues (especially in high-churn states) are recommended. Additionally, the older demographic requires tailored interventions to address their unique needs and preferences.
